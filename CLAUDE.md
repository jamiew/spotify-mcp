### Git Workflow & Development Process

**When working on this repository, follow this development workflow:**

1. **Read Current Status**: Always start by reading the latest TODO items and status in this CLAUDE.md file
2. **Work Through TODOs**: If no other instructions provided, work through the "Immediate Action Items" section systematically
3. **Quality Gates**: Before any commit, ALWAYS run:
   - `uv run mypy src/` - Type checking must pass
   - `uv run pytest` - All tests must pass
   - Only commit when code is working and validated
4. **Commit Strategy**: Make focused, single-purpose commits:
   - One commit per bug fix, feature, or optimization
   - Use descriptive commit messages explaining the "why" not just "what"
   - Include the standard footer in all commits
5. **Documentation Updates**: Update CLAUDE.md with:
   - Current development status
   - New TODO items discovered during implementation
   - Completed work and performance impacts
   - Update frequency: After major features, not every small commit

**Commit Message Format:**
```
Brief description of change (imperative mood)

More detailed explanation of what and why this change was made.
Include performance impacts, API changes, or user-facing improvements.

ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**Development Cycle:**
1. Check current TODOs in CLAUDE.md "Immediate Action Items"
2. Implement one focused change (bug fix, feature, optimization)
3. Run type checking: `uv run mypy src/`
4. Run tests: `uv run pytest`
5. Commit with descriptive message if all checks pass
6. Move to next TODO item
7. Update CLAUDE.md status after completing major milestones

**Quality Standards:**
- No commits with failing type checks or tests
- Each commit should be a complete, working unit
- Prefer smaller, focused commits over large changes
- Always validate changes work before committing
- Update documentation when adding new features or changing behavior

### Required Environment Variables
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` - Spotify API Client ID
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` - Spotify API Client Secret  
- `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI` - Default: http://localhost:8888

### Optional Environment Variables
- `LOGGING_PATH` - Path for additional file logs (all logging including analytics goes to Claude's MCP console by default)

### Environment Configuration Priority
The application uses a sophisticated three-tier configuration system:
1. **Environment variables** (highest priority) - for MCP/production usage
2. **`.env` file** - for local development (optional, create in project root)
3. **pyproject.toml defaults** - fallback values configured in `[tool.spotify-mcp.env]`

This means you can:
- **MCP usage**: External env vars take precedence (no setup needed)
- **Local development**: Either set env vars, create a `.env` file, OR edit `pyproject.toml` defaults
- **Testing**: Zero setup required (uses `pytest-env` configuration)
- **New contributors**: Can get started immediately using `pyproject.toml` defaults

### Setting Up Development Credentials
Option 1 - Edit `pyproject.toml` (simplest):
```toml
[tool.spotify-mcp.env]
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = "your_actual_client_id"
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = "your_actual_client_secret"
```

Option 2 - Create `.env` file:
```bash
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_actual_client_secret
```

Option 3 - Environment variables:
```bash
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_actual_client_secret
```
