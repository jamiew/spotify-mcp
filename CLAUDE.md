### Git Workflow & Development Process

**When working on this repository, follow this development workflow:**

1. **Read Current Status**: Always start by reading the latest TODO items and status in this CLAUDE.md file
2. **Work Through TODOs**: If no other instructions provided, work through the "Immediate Action Items" section systematically
3. **Quality Gates**: Before any commit, ALWAYS run:
   - `uv run mypy src/` - Type checking must pass
   - `uv run pytest` - All tests must pass
   - Only commit when code is working and validated
4. **Commit Strategy**: Make focused, single-purpose commits:
   - One commit per bug fix, feature, or optimization
   - Use descriptive commit messages explaining the "why" not just "what"
   - Include the standard footer in all commits
5. **Documentation Updates**: Update CLAUDE.md with:
   - Current development status
   - New TODO items discovered during implementation
   - Completed work and performance impacts
   - Update frequency: After major features, not every small commit

**Commit Message Format:**
```
Brief description of change (imperative mood)

More detailed explanation of what and why this change was made.
Include performance impacts, API changes, or user-facing improvements.

ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**Development Cycle:**
1. Check current TODOs in CLAUDE.md "Immediate Action Items"
2. Implement one focused change (bug fix, feature, optimization)
3. Run type checking: `uv run mypy src/`
4. Run tests: `uv run pytest`
5. Commit with descriptive message if all checks pass
6. Move to next TODO item
7. Update CLAUDE.md status after completing major milestones

**Quality Standards:**
- No commits with failing type checks or tests
- Each commit should be a complete, working unit
- Prefer smaller, focused commits over large changes
- Always validate changes work before committing
- Update documentation when adding new features or changing behavior

### Required Environment Variables
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` - Spotify API Client ID
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` - Spotify API Client Secret  
- `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI` - Default: http://localhost:8888

### Optional Environment Variables
- `LOGGING_PATH` - Path for additional file logs (all logging including analytics goes to Claude's MCP console by default)

### Environment Configuration Priority
The application uses a sophisticated three-tier configuration system:
1. **Environment variables** (highest priority) - for MCP/production usage
2. **`.env` file** - for local development (optional, create in project root)
3. **pyproject.toml defaults** - fallback values configured in `[tool.spotify-mcp.env]`

This means you can:
- **MCP usage**: External env vars take precedence (no setup needed)
- **Local development**: Either set env vars, create a `.env` file, OR edit `pyproject.toml` defaults
- **Testing**: Zero setup required (uses `pytest-env` configuration)
- **New contributors**: Can get started immediately using `pyproject.toml` defaults

### Setting Up Development Credentials
Option 1 - Edit `pyproject.toml` (simplest):
```toml
[tool.spotify-mcp.env]
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = "your_actual_client_id"
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = "your_actual_client_secret"
```

Option 2 - Create `.env` file:
```bash
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_actual_client_secret
```

Option 3 - Environment variables:
```bash
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_actual_client_secret
```

## Architecture

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates Claude with Spotify's Web API. Built using Python with `uv` as the package manager.

### Core Components

#### `src/spotify_mcp/fastmcp_server.py` 
- Main MCP server implementation using the modern **FastMCP framework**
- Defines 13 focused MCP tools using `@mcp.tool()` decorators with Pydantic models:
  - `playback_control` - Control Spotify playback (get/start/pause/skip)
  - `search_tracks` - Search for tracks, albums, artists, playlists (with pagination)
  - `add_to_queue` - Add track to playback queue
  - `get_queue` - Get current playback queue
  - `get_track_info` - Get detailed track information
  - `get_artist_info` - Get artist information with top tracks
  - `get_playlist_info` - Get playlist metadata (no tracks)
  - `get_playlist_tracks` - Get playlist tracks with full pagination support
  - `create_playlist` - Create new Spotify playlists
  - `add_tracks_to_playlist` - Batch add tracks to playlists (up to 100 per call)
  - `get_user_playlists` - Get user's playlists with metadata (with pagination)
  - `remove_tracks_from_playlist` - Remove tracks from playlists
  - `modify_playlist_details` - Update playlist name, description, privacy

#### `src/spotify_mcp/spotify_api.py`
- Spotify API client wrapper using `spotipy` library
- Handles OAuth authentication with comprehensive scopes
- Implements all Spotify operations with error handling and logging
- Uses `@validate` decorator for auth/device validation

#### `src/spotify_mcp/utils.py`
- Data parsing utilities to normalize Spotify API responses
- Functions: `parse_track()`, `parse_artist()`, `parse_album()`, `parse_playlist()`
- Search query builder with advanced filters
- `@validate` decorator for authentication and device management

### Authentication Flow
- Uses SpotifyOAuth with required scopes for playback, playlists, and library access
- Token caching handled automatically by spotipy
- Device validation ensures active Spotify device for playback operations

### Pagination Support

The server provides comprehensive pagination support for handling large datasets efficiently:

#### Pagination-Enabled Tools

**`search_tracks`** - Search with pagination
- Parameters: `limit` (1-50, default 10), `offset` (default 0)
- Returns: Dict with `items`, `total`, `limit`, `offset`, `next`, `previous`
- Usage: `search_tracks("pop", limit=20, offset=40)` gets results 41-60

**`get_user_playlists`** - User's playlists with pagination  
- Parameters: `limit` (1-50, default 20), `offset` (default 0)
- Returns: Dict with `items` (list of playlists) and pagination metadata
- Usage: `get_user_playlists(limit=50, offset=100)` gets playlists 101-150

**`get_playlist_tracks`** - Dedicated playlist tracks with full pagination
- Parameters: `limit` (None for all, default), `offset` (default 0) 
- Returns: Dict with `items` (tracks), `total`, `returned` count
- Usage: `get_playlist_tracks(playlist_id, limit=100, offset=200)` gets tracks 201-300
- Special: `limit=None` gets ALL tracks (up to 10,000 safety limit)

#### Pagination Best Practices

**For Large Playlists (>100 tracks):**
1. Use `get_item_info()` first to check `total_tracks` 
2. Use `get_playlist_tracks()` with batching: `limit=100, offset=0/100/200...`
3. Consider sampling rather than processing all tracks for analysis

**For Search Exploration:**
1. Start with `limit=20` for quick overview
2. Use `offset` to explore deeper: `offset=20, 40, 60...`
3. Try different queries rather than just advancing offset
4. Maximum useful offset is usually around 100-200

**For User Playlists:**
1. Check `total` in response to determine if more pages exist
2. Use `offset` in multiples of your `limit` size
3. Spotify enforces maximum of 50 playlists per request

#### Memory and Performance

- **Batch sizes**: Tools automatically use optimal Spotify API batch sizes (100 for playlists)
- **Safety limits**: 10,000 track limit prevents infinite loops and excessive memory usage
- **Progressive loading**: Get first page quickly, then paginate through remaining as needed
- **Structured responses**: All paginated tools return consistent metadata for navigation

### Deployment Options
1. **Local development**: Clone repo and run with `uv`
2. **Claude Desktop**: Add to MCP configuration with environment variables
3. **Smithery**: Automated installation via `npx @smithery/cli install`

### Dependencies
- **mcp[cli]**: Model Context Protocol framework with CLI support (>=1.12.0)
- **spotipy**: Spotify Web API wrapper (>=2.25.0)
- **python-dotenv**: Environment variable loading (>=1.1.0)
- **pydantic**: Data validation built into FastMCP framework

## Development Best Practices & Modernization Guide

**‚ö†Ô∏è No Backwards Compatibility**: We always roll forward with modern patterns. Do not maintain legacy tool signatures or return formats.

### üéØ Core Design Philosophy

**1. Single Responsibility Tools**
- ‚ùå **Old**: `manage_queue(action="add|get")` - multi-purpose with string switches
- ‚úÖ **New**: `add_to_queue()` + `get_queue()` - focused, single-purpose tools
- **Why**: Clearer tool discovery, better parameter validation, easier testing

**2. Consistent Return Formats** 
- ‚ùå **Old**: Mix of lists, raw models, `.model_dump()` calls
- ‚úÖ **New**: Always return structured `Dict[str, Any]` with consistent patterns
- **Why**: Predictable API, better client integration, easier testing

**3. Pagination-First Design**
- ‚ùå **Old**: Hard-coded limits like `limit=50` in playlist tools  
- ‚úÖ **New**: Pagination parameters on all tools that can return large datasets
- **Why**: Handles real-world usage, prevents truncation surprises

### üîß Tool Design Patterns

**Preferred Tool Signatures:**
```python
@mcp.tool()
def specific_action(required_param: str, optional_param: int = default) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    \"\"\"Single-purpose tool with clear intent.
    
    Args:
        required_param: Clear description with type
        optional_param: Default values for convenience
        
    Returns:
        Dict with structured data and metadata
        
    Note: Include usage guidance for complex scenarios
    \"\"\"
```

**Return Format Standards:**
```python
# For paginated results
return {
    "items": [...],           # Main data
    "total": 1500,           # Total available  
    "limit": 100,            # Page size used
    "offset": 200,           # Starting position
    "next": "...",           # Pagination URLs
    "previous": "..."
}

# For single items/actions
return {
    "data": {...},           # Main result
    "status": "success",     # Action status
    "message": "...",        # Human-readable result
    "metadata": {...}        # Additional context
}
```

### üö´ Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**1. Multi-Purpose Tools with String Actions**
```python
# ‚ùå DON'T DO THIS
def manage_thing(action: str, param: Optional[str] = None):
    if action == "create":
        # ...
    elif action == "delete":
        # ...
```

**2. Inconsistent Return Types**  
```python
# ‚ùå DON'T DO THIS
def get_items(qtype: str):
    if qtype == "tracks":
        return list_of_tracks
    elif qtype == "playlists": 
        return {"playlists": data}
```

**3. Hard-Coded Limits**
```python  
# ‚ùå DON'T DO THIS
def get_playlist_tracks(playlist_id):
    return spotify.playlist_tracks(playlist_id, limit=50)  # Truncated!
```

**4. Generic Parameter Names**
```python
# ‚ùå DON'T DO THIS  
def get_info(item_id: str, qtype: str):  # What types? What info?

# ‚úÖ DO THIS
def get_track_info(track_id: str):       # Clear intent
def get_artist_info(artist_id: str):     # Specific purpose
```

### üí° Code Quality Standards

**Type Safety:**
- Use strict type hints on all functions
- Leverage Pydantic models for structured data
- Run `mypy` in CI/CD pipeline

**Error Handling:**
- Convert all Spotify exceptions to MCP-compliant errors
- Provide helpful error messages with suggested actions
- Include relevant context in error responses

**Documentation:**
- Tool docstrings must include Args, Returns, and usage notes
- Complex tools need examples in docstring
- Update CLAUDE.md when adding new patterns

**Testing:**
- All new tools require comprehensive tests
- Test both success and failure scenarios  
- Mock external API calls consistently
- Verify pagination logic with large datasets

### üîÑ Refactoring Guidelines

**When Modernizing Legacy Code:**

1. **Identify the pattern**: Multi-action tool? Mixed returns? Hard limits?
2. **Split by responsibility**: Create focused, single-purpose tools
3. **Standardize returns**: Use consistent `Dict[str, Any]` patterns
4. **Add pagination**: If tool can return >20 items, add pagination
5. **Update tests**: Match new signatures and return formats
6. **No compatibility**: Don't keep old tools around

**Tool Evolution Process:**
```python
# Step 1: Identify legacy pattern
def get_item_info(item_id: str, qtype: str):  # Generic, multi-purpose

# Step 2: Create focused replacements
def get_track_info(track_id: str):           # Single purpose
def get_artist_info(artist_id: str):         # Single purpose  
def get_playlist_info(playlist_id: str):     # Single purpose

# Step 3: Remove original (no backwards compatibility)
# delete get_item_info entirely
```

### üìä Current Architecture Strengths

### üîß Implementation Notes for LLM Tool Usage

**Tool Parameter Best Practices:**
```python
@mcp.tool()
def example_tool(
    required_id: str,           # Always validate required params
    limit: int = 20,           # Sensible defaults for pagination
    offset: int = 0,           # Always start at 0
    include_metadata: bool = True  # Feature flags for extended data
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Clear single-line description.
    
    Extended description with usage context and performance notes.
    
    Args:
        required_id: Specific format (e.g., "Spotify track ID (22 chars)")
        limit: Range and recommendations (e.g., "1-50, default 20 for performance")
        offset: Pagination guidance (e.g., "Use multiples of limit for pages")
        include_metadata: When to enable (e.g., "Include for analysis, disable for speed")
        
    Returns:
        Structured response with data and metadata sections
        
    Performance Tips:
        - Use limit=50 for bulk operations
        - Enable include_metadata only when analyzing data
        - For large datasets, consider multiple smaller requests
        
    Example:
        get_playlist_tracks("37i9dQZF1DX0XUsuxWHRQd", limit=100, offset=0)
    """
```

**LLM Usage Hints in Documentation:**
- Include realistic parameter ranges and recommendations
- Explain when to use specific combinations of parameters  
- Provide performance guidance for different use cases
- Show example workflows for common scenarios

This comprehensive approach ensures tools are both powerful and easy for LLMs to use effectively.
